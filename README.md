This fork of simd-json is just for benchmarking memory allocators using simd-json as a testbed.

To run these benchmarks and generate textual and graphical results files, run:

```code
bench-allocators.sh
```

See the README of [the upstream simd-json repository](https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json) for
information about simd-json.
